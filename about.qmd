## Global Point Prevalence Survey (Global-PPS) and Its Relevance to Tamale Teaching Hospital

The **Global Point Prevalence Survey of Antimicrobial Consumption and Resistance (Global-PPS)** is a worldwide initiative that provides hospitals and healthcare centers with a **free, web-based tool** to monitor and evaluate antimicrobial prescribing practices and resistance patterns. It is designed to help institutions understand their antibiotic use and identify areas for improvement in stewardship and infection control.

### Why Participate in Global-PPS?

At **Tamale Teaching Hospital (TTH)**, where antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an emerging public health concern, participating in the Global-PPS offers several critical benefits:

- **Benchmarking and Evaluation**: TTH can assess the **quantity and quality** of antimicrobial prescriptions across wards, including surgical, medical, pediatric, and neonatal units.
- **Targeted Interventions**: The survey helps identify **inappropriate prescribing patterns** and **high-risk areas** for Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAIs), guiding the development of **local stewardship strategies**.
- **Impact Measurement**: By conducting repeated PPS rounds, TTH can **track progress** over time and evaluate the **effectiveness of interventions** aimed at improving antimicrobial use.
- **Global Collaboration**: TTH joins a **global network of hospitals**, contributing data that supports international efforts to combat AMR and improve patient safety.

### Strategic Importance for TTH

Given TTH's role as a **tertiary referral center** in Northern Ghana, the Global-PPS aligns with its mission to deliver evidence-based care and strengthen infection prevention and control (IPC). The insights gained from the survey can inform **clinical guidelines**, support **training for prescribers**, and enhance **data-driven decision-making** in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
