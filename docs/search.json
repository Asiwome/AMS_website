    "text": "Key Findings\n\nAntimicrobial Use Prevalence\nOverall Rate: 65.1%, with 278 out of 427 surveyed patients receiving at least one antimicrobial agent. Visual charts show variation in use across departments, with some departments exceeding 65.1% the hospital wide rate.\n\n\n\n\n\nAntimicrobial Use Prevalence by Department\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndications for Prescribing\nInfection Types: Distribution includes respiratory, urinary, surgical site, and bloodstream infections.\n\n\nIndications for Prescribing\nInfection Types: Distribution of indicators includes Community Acquired Infections, Surgical Prophylaxis and Hospital Acquired Infections.\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution of Infection Types\n\n\n\n\nEmpirical vs. Targeted Therapy: Majority of prescriptions were empirical, reflecting low culture submission rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Distribution of Empirical vs Targeted Therapy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntimicrobial Classes & Agents\nTop Agents: Ceftriaxone, Metronidazole, and cefuroxime were most frequently prescribed. With a balanced 1:1 AWaRe Ratio\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Frequently Prescribed Antimicrobial Agents\n\n\n\n\nWHO AWaRe Classification: Majority of agents fall under the ‘Watch’ category, indicating potential for resistance.\n\nThe Access-to-Watch ratio is nearly 1:1, which is not ideal. WHO recommends a higher proportion of Access antibiotics to minimize resistance risks.\nThis balance suggests a need for stewardship interventions to promote Access agents and reduce reliance on Watch antibiotics unless clinically justified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution of Antimicrobials by WHO AWaRe Classification\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuality Indicators Compliance\n\nStop/Review Date (56.2%): Moderate compliance; over half of prescriptions had a review date, but improvement is needed to ensure timely reassessment.\nGuideline Adherence (45.2%): Low adherence; indicates a need for training and regular audits to promote evidence-based prescribing.\nCulture Before Treatment (14.7%): Critically low; reflects poor diagnostic stewardship and over-reliance on empirical therapy.\nBiomarker-Based Treatment (34.1%): Limited use; suggests potential to expand diagnostic support for antimicrobial decisions.\nReason for Indication Documented (40.8%): Weak documentation; undermines accountability and hinders audit effectiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompliance with Antimicrobial Stewardship Quality Indicators\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrobiology & Resistance Data\nCulture Submission Rates by Ward: Lowest in high-prescribing wards such as Surgery and A&E.\nResistance Trends: Data not available; future surveys should include antibiogram analysis.\n\n\nDepartmental Contributions to Antimicrobial Consumption\nHighest Rates:\n-Internal Medicine (23.1%) and Surgery (22.5%) lead in culture submission, but still far below ideal (&gt;80%).\nModerate Rates:\n-TTH overall (14.7%), Paediatrics (14.1%), and Obstetrics & Gynaecology (12.2%) show low compliance.\nCritical Gaps:\n\nAccident & Emergency (5.9%) and Orthopaedics & Trauma (5%) have very poor submission rates.\nDEENT and Polyclinic (0%) indicate no cultures submitted at all, which is alarming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrobiological Culture Submission Rates Before Treatment by Ward\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Wards/Unit contributing to Most of AM Consumption\n\nLeft Side (Red Bars): These wards account for the largest share of antimicrobial use. The first three represent the top contributors i.e ICU, MICU, and NICU.\nCumulative curve reaches ~80% by around 22 out of 36 wards, contributes most of the antimicrobial consumption.\nRight Side (Gray Bars): Wards with lower antimicrobial use have minimal impact on overall consumption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Wards/Unit contributing to Most of AM Consumption"
